      <h1>An Open Letter to You, My Love</h1>
      <p>I’m writing this because words alone haven’t been enough to show you how deeply sorry I am. This website is my way of not only apologizing but also honoring the love we’ve shared and the person I’ve become because of you.
         I’ve made mistakes,mistakes that hurt you, mistakes that pushed you away, and mistakes that made you question the love I’ve always had for you. I’ve reflected deeply on those moments, and every memory brings with it the weight of my regret. I see now how my actions my impulsivity, my words, and my failure to communicate properly hurt you in ways I didn’t understand at the time. For that, I am so, so sorry</p>

      <h2>I See What I Did Wrong</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I didn’t communicate enough:</strong> When I shut you out or went to others for advice instead of coming to you, I made you feel undervalued and excluded. You were right to feel that way, and I should have been your partner in everything.</li>
        <li><strong>I let outside influences affect us:</strong>  My family, my past, my friend and even my own fears clouded the way I treated you. You didn’t deserve to feel hidden or judged because of things that weren’t your fault.  .</li>
        <li><strong>I let my anger and insecurities take control:</strong> When I felt overwhelmed, I lashed out instead of leaning on you. I see now how much that hurt you, and I promise to be better.</li>
        <li><strong>I made you feel like you weren’t enough:</strong> The way I turned to others or failed to see your worth in moments of weakness was never about you,it was my own flaws, and I’m working on them every day.</li>

      <h2>You Are Enough, and You Always Have Been</h2>
      <p>you’ve shown me love, patience, and understanding that I didn’t always deserve. Through everything, you’ve been the light in my life, even when I let my own darkness overshadow it. You’ve always been enough, more than enough. You’re kind, loving, and resilient, and I’m so grateful for every moment we’ve shared, even the difficult ones. I want you to know that I’m not giving up. I’m working on becoming a better version of myself, not just for you, but for me, for us. I want to be the partner who makes you feel safe, loved, and valued every single day.</p>
